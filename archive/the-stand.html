Suddenly he heard a voice that was to change the course of his life and that of his home town, Almolonga. “I was lying there and I saw Jesus saying, ‘I love you and I want you to serve me’,” says the man, Mariano Riscajche. He dusted himself down, sobered up and soon started preaching, establishing a small Protestant congregation in a room not far from the town’s ancient Catholic church.</p><p class="article__body-text">At the heart of this Protestant faith were, and are, three beliefs resting on the Latin word for “alone”: <em>sola fide</em> (that people are saved by faith in Jesus alone, not by anything they do); <em>sola gratia </em>(that this faith is given by grace alone, and cannot be earned); and <em>sola scriptura</em> (that it is based on the authority of the Bible alone, and not on tradition or the church). In a way that complemented the broader themes of the Renaissance, Luther wanted Christianity to go back to the “pristine Gospel”: the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. This return offered a new sort of freedom, one centred on the individual, which helped pave the way for modernity. “The separation of powers, toleration, freedom of conscience, they are all Protestant ideas,” says Jacques Berlinerblau, a sociologist at Georgetown University.</p><p class="article__body-text">Protestantism continues to change lives today; indeed, over the recent decades the number of its adherents has grown substantially. Since the 1970s, about three-quarters of Almolonga’s 14,000 residents have converted; more than 40% of Guatemala’s population is now Protestant. Its story is a microcosm of a broader “Protestant awakening” across Latin America and the developing world. According to the Pew Research Centre Protestants currently make up slightly less than 40% of the world’s 2.3bn Christians; almost all the rest are Roman Catholics. The United States is home to some 150m Protestants, the largest number in any country.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are many ways to be a Protestant, from the quietist to the ecstatic. The fastest-growing varieties tend to be the evangelical ones, which emphasise the need for spiritual rebirth and Biblical authority. Among developing-world evangelicals, Pentecostals are dominant; their version of the faith is charismatic, in that it emphasises the “gifts” of the Holy Spirit, held to be a universally accessible and sustaining aspect of God. These gifts include healing, prophecy and glossolalia. According to the World Christian Database at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, Pentecostals and other evangelicals and charismatics account for 35% of Europe’s Protestants, 74% of America’s and 88% of those in developing countries. They make up more than half of the developing world’s Christians, and 10% of all people on Earth.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1100/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/172/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/258/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/344/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/516/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/550/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/688/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/859/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1100/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20171104_ESC998_0.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">It is a bootstrapping faith. Anyone pulling himself up in the world can join. Many of those who do are from the margins of society. Churches provide migrants in their congregations with employment, support and the possibility of advancement. Where the faith is not part of the establishment, as in Latin America or China, it carries the potential for disruption.</p><p class="article__body-text">Few economists these days put much stock in Weber’s views. They point out that there was plenty of proto-capitalism—in 13th-century Italian city-states, for instance—before the Reformation, and the development of its modern form was influenced by many other factors. Today the idea seems out of date: the borders that once ensured an overlap between national markets and economic moralities have given way to capital flows and a consumer culture in which unrestricted gratification seems to be the norm.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/608/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESD002_0.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">It was change from within that Luther wanted.

He still believed in Christendom, but his experience of God persuaded him that the church was getting it wrong.</p><p class="article__body-text">To begin with, Luther and other Protestants were keen that church and state should continue to be bound together—just with much clearer lines between their realms of authority. Keeping the state out of the church’s business meant clerics lost the power to suppress heretics by force. But Luther was content with that. He insisted that heresy should be fought from pulpits and in pamphlets, not by coercion. “Let the spirits collide,” he wrote. “If meanwhile some are led astray, all right, such is war.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The division in Protestantism had political repercussions. The German Peasants’ Revolt in 1524-25 was led by men who denounced serfdom as incompatible with Christian liberty and said they would desist only if they could be proved wrong on Biblical grounds. Luther was shocked at what he had unleashed, penning a pamphlet entitled “Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants”. But it was too late. The sects would not do as they were told. If God had spoken to them directly through his word, what was there to fear from kings and bishops?</p><p class="article__body-text">The resistance of dissenters impressed John Locke, an English philosopher with strong Protestant roots. Their stand influenced his writings on freedom of conscience, which were to form the foundation for English liberalism, and the Toleration Act of 1689, which formalised the legal acceptance of nonconformist sects. The participatory ways in which nonconformist churches often chose their leaders eventually filtered through to society in general. “Churches were schools of democracy,” says David Martin, a British sociologist of religion.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1104/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/173/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/259/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/345/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/518/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/552/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/690/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/863/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1104/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC999_0.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Before the Toleration Act and other developments made Britain and northern Europe more amenable to radical Protestantism, many seeking religious freedom had crossed the Atlantic to secure it. A strong tradition of radical Protestantism became a feature of the American colonies and the subsequent history of the United States, refreshed from time to time by revivalist “great awakenings”. That America became the fullest example of limited government enshrined in law is in large part a consequence of its Protestant settlement. The truths the Founding Fathers held to be self-evident had not seemed so to anyone before the Reformation.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/693/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/108/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/162/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/217/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/325/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/347/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/433/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/541/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/693/90/sites/default/files/20171104_ESC900_0.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">That does not mean the faith is egalitarian. Pentecostalism reforms traditional gender roles rather than abolishing them; it tends to be robustly patriarchal, and profoundly intolerant of homosexuality. But a sober patriarch committed to a moral code that, crucially, treats domestic violence as sinful can provide stability. An acceptance of birth control also eases women’s lot.</p><p class="article__body-text">Pentecostals have traditionally been suspicious of politics as too “worldly” and of development work as too long-term. But in Guatemala and elsewhere some are now mobilising for social change. Witness a rap battle in a community hall in one of the areas of Guatemala City known as “red zones”. Teenagers take it in turns to get up on stage and rap against each other, with judges deciding who goes through to the next round. The event has been organised by Angel, a local man who joined one of the city’s notorious gangs when he was 14. By the age of 22, he had shot “a lot of people”, he says. When he found himself about to be executed by a rival gang, he called out to God for help; he escaped death and was born again. For the past ten years, in a typically Pentecostal bottom-up initiative, he has been saving kids from gangs.</p><p class="article__body-text">Unlike Catholics, Pentecostals have no unified theology of the state, nor any well-formulated programme for sociopolitical reform. To the extent that they are political at all, they merely think that their co-religionists should be elected and that their countries should be Christian.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/542/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/85/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/127/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/169/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/254/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/271/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/339/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/423/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/542/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20171104_esd003.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">As interdenominational divisions have healed, some individual churches have started to fall apart. In the Anglican communion, which contains the Church of England and many of its offshoots, homosexuality is driving a wedge between believers in the northern hemisphere, many of whom increasingly
