In grainy newsreels, Eva and Juan Perón (pictured) address multitudes in the Plaza de Mayo, the city’s main square. One reel shows a demonstration by workers on October 17th 1945 that secured the freedom of Colonel Perón, as he then was, after a brief imprisonment—events that would propel him to victory in a presidential election. </p<br><br><p class="article__body-text">Perón pledged that he would “place myself at the complete service of the true Argentine people”. Eva Perón insisted: “I want nothing for me. I only want to be Perón’s shield and my people’s flag.” In her last public speech before dying of cancer aged just 33, she declared: “I will always do what the people say.”</p<br><p class="article__body-text">Such are the building blocks of populism. For a start, it requires charismatic leadership, to which absolute loyalty is owed. It helps, too, to invoke the notion of a “true people”, and of an enemy that opposes them—the “oligarchy” and the United States in the case of the Peróns. A dash of drama is added to the mix; Eva is recalled as a tragic victim. Combined with this was their commitment to social justice: the eight-hour day, wage increases, paid holidays and welfare schemes.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">It was a successful formula. Perón was overthrown by a military coup in 1955. But the movement which he called Justicialismo and everyone else calls Peronism has, with many twists and turns, dominated Argentina’s political life ever since. It is still in power, as it has been for 16 of the past 20 years. And it has been copied, with varying degrees of success, across Latin America. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Yet Peronism is now at perhaps its lowest ebb. The energy, grace and teamwork of Argentina’s footballers find no echoes in its government. Alberto Fernández, Argentina’s president since 2019, heads a weak, divided and failing administration. October 17th, the Day of Peronist Loyalty as it is dubbed in tribute to that 1945 demonstration, saw three rival commemorations in 2022. Mr Fernández did not attend any of them. Nor did Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (no relation), the vice-president and the most powerful figure in Peronism since the death of her husband, Néstor, in 2010. Mr Fernández and Ms Kirchner go months without speaking to each other. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Ms Kirchner has her own problems. On December 6th a federal court convicted her of defrauding the state on public-works contracts worth $1bn and imposed a six-year jail sentence and permanent disqualification from public office. She claims that, like Evita, she is a victim. In her case she claims that a “judicial mafia”, the media and Mauricio Macri, the conservative president between 2015 and 2019, are determined to drive her out of politics. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Others note that while they were politicians she and her husband amassed a fortune of $10m, which she declared to the anti-corruption agency when stepping down after eight years as president in 2015. She says she will appeal the verdict. But she also surprised her followers by saying that she would not seek to run for office in the general election due in October 2023. That may be a ruse. But it may also reflect her dwindling public support. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Peronism is also out of ideas, as Argentina’s chronic economic crisis highlights. Mr Macri tried but failed to stabilise the economy he inherited after a decade of overspending by the Kirchners. Mr Fernández’s government has tried only half-heartedly. He forced through approval of a $44bn loan from the <small>IMF</small> that is essential to support the peso but requires tighter monetary and fiscal policy. Ms Kirchner’s allies voted against the <small>IMF</small> agreement, requiring the government to rely on the opposition. She blocked moves to cut indiscriminate subsidies for electricity, gas and public transport which add to the deficit. She half-relented when the peso plunged in July, consenting to the appointment of Sergio Massa as economy minister with a mandate to implement the <small>IMF</small> agreement. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Today the economy is held together by a battery of price and exchange controls. Even so, inflation will be close to 100% this year, and in the (tolerated) black market the peso is worth less than a quarter of its value three years ago. The government lives from week to week. Some 37% of the population are poor, up from 28% in 2011, according to <small>CEDLAS</small>, a think-tank, using a poverty line of 120,000 pesos a month for a family of four ($698 at the official exchange rate or $381 at the unofficial rate).</p<br><p class="article__body-text">Peronism’s decline is interwoven with that of the country as a whole. “Peronism is obviously the main culprit for the situation of Argentina,” Eduardo Duhalde, a former governor and president from the movement, says bluntly. “Today we’re in our worst moment.” </p<br><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1286/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/423/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/635/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/846/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1269/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1354/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1692/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/2115/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2707/90/media-assets/image/20221217_AMC128.png 1280w"  alt=""/</div><br><p class="article__body-text">In 1914 Argentina was one of the ten richest countries in the world, albeit a very unequal one. In the mid-1970s it was still a predominantly middle-class country. No longer. The past half-century has seen underlying decline punctuated by temporary rebounds (see chart). In the 1990s Carlos Menem, a Peronist president, adopted free-market policies and capital flooded in for a while. But a fixed and overvalued exchange rate, combined with loose fiscal policy, culminated in economic and financial collapse in 2001. A commodity boom came to the rescue under the Kirchners, until 2012. Then distortions kicked in.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">The problem is that populism generates expectations that it cannot meet. There are two consequences. Mr Fernández’s government, like several of its predecessors, finances itself partly by printing money. Long experience means that Argentines distrust the peso. All this generates inflation, which the government masks with multiple exchange rates, offering cheap dollars for selected imports and discriminating against exports. A second problem is that it shields vested interests—such as uncompetitive industrialists and union barons—who receive unaffordable subsidies and privileges, prompting a chronic fiscal deficit.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">Economic decline has altered society and forced Peronism to adapt. Perón himself was a fan of Benito Mussolini but also of the British Labour Party. He had a pragmatic streak. He forged Peronism from fascism, the labour movement, the Catholic conservatism of the local bosses in Argentina’s backward northern and western provinces and the armed forces (though they would later turn against him).</p<br><p class="article__body-text">But today Argentina is very different. It is more secular. After the abuses of the military dictatorship of 1976 to 1983, civilian governments slashed the army’s size and budget. And the unions are weaker, too. For the past 15 years almost all net job creation has been in the informal sector, according to Juan Luis Bour of Fiel, a think-tank. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Peronism has survived by organising and representing the informal economy, through social movements and a powerful clientelistic network in the poorer suburbs of cities. These Peronist social movements are now divided, with some supporting Mr Fernández, others Ms Kirchner and some leaders closer to Pope Francis, who was previously the archbishop of Buenos Aires and was long a Peronist sympathiser.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">But Peronism has always suffered from internal tensions. Loris Zanatta, an Italian political scientist who studies the movement, says that its abiding orthodoxy is nationalism: “It is not an ordinary political party but [instead] incarnates the essence of the <i>patria </i>(fatherland).” That religion of the <i>patria</i> has sometimes coexisted with a more left-wing strand. Mr Fernández, for example, calls himself a social democrat and promoted a law to legalise abortion. Axel Kicillof, the governor of Buenos Aires province, is an heir to Ms Kirchner who retains some of his original leftism. Peronism “struggles for equality of opportunity in a very unequal country”, he says. “The struggle for dignity is very important.”</p<br><p class="article__body-text">Under a powerful leader, Peronism’s breadth can be the movement’s strength. But under a weak one, it can become woolly. Ms Kirchner still has the ability to mobilise the poor. Mr Zanatta thinks that she wants to whip up enough support for her to remain in politics by posing as a victim. “She is harking back to Evita and her renouncing of the candidacy for vice-president in 1951,” he says. But she has sought to divide rather than unite Argentines. Mr Massa represents a third, more liberal, strand in Peronism which was in power in the 1990s under Menem. As Kirchnerismo wanes, that strand may come back. But some think that Peronism might split. </p<br><p class="article__body-text">Peronism is woven so deeply into the national fibre that it is hard to imagine it disappearing. Its religious quality emphasises emotion and redemption. “Peronists can make mistakes but we have to continue to be Peronists,” says Sonia Manzoni, the leader of a small co-operative producing nursery plants that is part of the Movimiento Evita, a Peronist social movement, tucked in former railway scrubland close to affluent Palermo.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">In the short term, Peronism’s decline suggests that the centre-right opposition will win the election next year, provided it can overcome its own internal divisions and manage to see off competition from Javier Milei, a libertarian popular with the young. Some political scientists believe the opposition may win an absolute majority in Congress, which would allow it to impose the radical economic reforms that Mr Macri ducked. As well as cutting spending to eliminate the deficit and unifying the exchange rate, these include tackling vested interests. Such reforms could restore confidence in the peso, attract flight capital to return and, eventually, prompt growth. But “reforms have many losers in the short term,” warns Eduardo Levy Yeyati, an economist advising the opposition.</p<br><p class="article__body-text">For some that suggests the next government will have to build a broad coalition. It might have one thing going for it. “The crisis we’re in generates a consensus for change which will allow us to achieve what in other periods wouldn’t be possible,” says Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, the mayor of Buenos Aires and on paper the opposition’s strongest presidential candidate. The long populist cycle that began in 1945 might just be drawing to a close. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p<br><script src="https://arielherself.github.io/espresso-native/mdui-v1.0.2/js/mdui.min.js"></script>
