On the eve of its opening, Deng Hong, the man who built the mall-and-office complex, disappeared.</p><p class="article__body-text">For years Mr Deng had received tributes in local media for turning farmland into glistening conference centres and hotels. The billionaire “conference king” walked with a swagger, chomped on cigars and knew how to please officials. Hefty contracts rolled his way, including one to develop a landmark in the suburbs of Chengdu, a city of 14m in south-western China. This, the New Century Global Centre, was to be his crowning accomplishment, the world’s largest structure by floor space, the size of 246 football fields, or nearly three Pentagons or eight Louvres.</p><p class="article__body-text">Today, more than five years on, the story has taken a series of surprising turns. For one, the building is not a disaster. During the summer, the waterpark is crowded. The mall has come to life, a testament to the rise of the middle class. The offices are a cauldron of activity: 30,000 people work there in every industry imaginable, from app design to veterinary care. Mr Deng has been released and is back in business, declaring last summer that he had a clean slate.</p><p class="article__body-text">The centre is now surrounded by broad roads and tall buildings. But for years the land it sits on was home to the fields of Huang Fenyu, a stout woman in her 50s, and the few thousand residents of Yumin village. Many lived by timeless rural rhythms, sowing rice in the spring and harvesting green stalks in the autumn.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Huang now works as a janitor in a nearby bank. She knows the compensation she received was paltry. The one time she went to the Global Centre for dinner, it cost her two days’ salary. “My heart ached,” she says. Even so, she is not bitter. Her new home has better plumbing and sturdier walls. The younger generation will, she says, benefit from a stronger economy. It is a quiet optimism that remains typical of modern China. Though nearly 5km from where she lives, the Centre is so big that it looks as if it is just down the street, its wavy roof outlined with neon lights at night. </p><p class="article__body-text">Three factors have underpinned this model. Each can be found in the origins of the Global Centre. The first is land, all of which is publicly owned. This puts a valuable asset at the disposal of local officials. They can offer cheap long-term rents to attract businesses or sell big leaseholds to developers. As long as growth continues, this is sound economic logic. Developers buy up land, assuming, mostly correctly, that they can sell what they build. For local governments it is a source of wealth. In Sichuan province, of which Chengdu is the capital, land sales bring in nearly as much as taxes.</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, Mr Li’s downfall offers a window into the nexus between government and business. Local officials can dole out contracts in exchange for benefits, like covering their children’s tuition overseas or buying homes for their relatives. The path is then clear for projects that in other countries would be almost inconceivable.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20190223_ESC252.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">The Global Centre is one of the many projects from that period that dot the country. Some are useful, such as China’s high-speed rail network. Others, less so: scores of cities built big futuristic districts but are still struggling to attract residents. China’s total debt soared from about 150% of <small>GDP</small> in 2008 to more than 250% today. Rapid increases of this magnitude have presaged financial trouble elsewhere, from the banking crises that ripped through the West a decade ago to Japan’s stagnation in the 1990s.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Many economists believe that corruption was, counter-intuitively, a lubricant for growth</cite></p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>F THE LESSONS</small> from the Global Centre’s construction seem gloomy, counter that with some time inside it. Here, China’s commercial promise is almost palpable. From the main entrance, visitors walk into a cavernous atrium which mixes high-end touches with a fairground atmosphere. The glossy marble floor is flanked by long gold-trimmed escalators. To the left is one large mall; to the right another. Straight ahead is the waterpark, under the glare of an ultra-long <small>LED</small> screen, projecting seaside scenes.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esp022.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">The park’s main attraction is a wave pool (pictured), which generates huge artificial swells. On a summer’s day, it is raucous. Hundreds of bathers are in the surf, many with mobile phones in plastic pouches hung around their necks. Pulsating music is blasted at top volume as dancers in bikinis take to elevated platforms.</p><p class="article__body-text">This scene underscores the long-awaited emergence of Chinese consumerism. China’s economy is often described as unbalanced. Investment accounts for nearly half of <small>GDP</small>, more than double the level of developed economies. Consumption, meanwhile, accounts for about a third of <small>GDP</small>, half the level of developed economies. Yet a simple emphasis on these two ratios misses something important, argues Arthur Kroeber, founder of Dragonomics, a China-focused research firm. Consumption has such a low share of <small>GDP</small> in China not because people are staying away from shops but because its investment has been unusually large.</p><p class="article__body-text">Estimates of the size of China’s middle class vary from 100m to 600m, depending on how it is measured. Precise estimates are beside the point. What matters is the direction of travel. Consumer numbers are destined only to grow. Even in an age of e-commerce, people flock to malls like the Global Centre. Along with the usual array of clothing stores and jewellery shops, there are toddlers’ play centres, virtual-reality arcades and cosplay cafés. On weekday evenings people queue outside restaurants on the top floor.</p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">C</span><small>ROWDS START</small> arriving at the Global Centre before nine in the morning every weekday, well before the shops open. They are the 30,000 people who work in the offices on its upper floors.

At the Quanxing law firm, Fu Shaojie talks of China’s progress in developing the rule of law. But he believes the law answers to the Communist Party, not the other way around. “We are making our system more democratic,” he says, explaining that this means his firm works with the government to stop disputes reaching courts. His waiting room displays a book with the collected wisdom of Xi Jinping, China’s president.</p><p class="article__body-text">In many industries, China’s entrepreneurs face more cut-throat competition than their Western peers. Take property: the ten biggest developers account for 30% of sales in America but around 15% in China. The rush into new industries can be frenzied. China already has more than 1,000 robotics firms.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc262.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">These two parts of the Chinese business world are often described as separate, as if plucky private firms are battling clumsy state-owned rivals. In reality they are deeply intertwined. The challenge for private firms is not so much how to compete against state firms as how to coexist with them. Wanjiang Gangli, a water-monitoring company with headquarters in the Global Centre, has seen its business boom as the government has targeted pollution. “In this system when leaders focus on an issue, it’s highly effective,” says He Xin, its general manager. But that same power makes for frustrations. To get contracts, his firm must partner with state firms, which have little technology but lots of political clout.</p><p class="article__body-text">This risks dulling the edge of the private sector. Normally, companies get higher returns as they grow and reap economies of scale. In China the reverse happens, says Mark Williams of Capital Economics, a research firm. His hypothesis is that big companies draw more attention from officials. Political meddling hurts them.</p><p class="article__body-text">Even when officials craft sensible policies, this imbalance can knock them off course. A dispiriting case has been their attempt to defuse financial dangers. To do so they have clamped down on shadow banking, a lightly regulated universe that includes everything from banks’ off-balance-sheet books to investment vehicles for the wealthy. Peer-to-peer lending is at the extreme risky end. One <small>P</small>2<small>P</small> firm, Zhongke Loans, resides inside the Global Centre. Wu Jinjun, its founder, describes his work with missionary verve. <small>P</small>2<small>P</small> lenders, he says, serve small borrowers, whom banks ignore.</p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">L</span><small>OTTE MALL</small>, a high-end South Korean department store in the Global Centre, normally wants to attract people. But on March 7th 2017, it was trying to keep them away. Despite a chill in the air, dozens had gathered on the plaza in front. They waved the Chinese flag, played the national anthem and unfurled banners, one of which read: “We will not tolerate violations of our motherland’s safety!” It was, in short, not a typical day for staff more accustomed to selling face cream.</p><p class="article__body-text">The tariffs are having big knock-on consequences. Her firm can charge more for delivering electronics, allowing it to defray the cost of moving heavier products. But with Chinese electronics now facing tariffs in America, the cost of shipping other products has gone up. And Ms Li expects 2019 to be even worse. Unless, that is, America and China reach some kind of deal. Already, China has watered down some of its joint-venture requirements for foreign carmakers and banks.</p><p class="article__body-text">Take the joint ventures. Perhaps the most notable fact is how rarely they have been effective. Despite an array of aviation partnerships, China has failed to create a decent passenger jet even after years of trying. A former industry minister famously described carmakers’ joint ventures as opium: Chinese firms are hooked on them for profits and make little of value themselves. Even theft only gets China so far. <small>IMAX</small>, for instance, believes the 3<small>D</small> technology stolen by its former employee is now outdated and that its Chinese rival has failed to keep up with its latest advances.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/articles/body/20190223_esc263.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Government subsidies also have shortcomings. DoubleFlyer, an education-technology company in the Global Centre, was granted a rent-free office in an industrial park in the suburbs. Such support works well for manufacturers but less well in knowledge-based industries. After six months Luo Sai, the young founder, moved DoubleFlyer back to the centre, to be closer to its business partners. Ms Li of Anbang Logistics raises her eyebrows at the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s mega-plan for investing abroad. Rail links between western China and Europe are the big accomplishment so far, an increasingly popular route for moving goods. But, without subsidies, she reckons that train costs would soar and exporters would go back to boats.</p><p class="article__body-text">The direction is far from certain. Soon after Mr Deng ran into legal troubles, he put his assets, including the Global Centre, on sale. A local fund manager who looked over the books proclaimed that maintenance was too expensive and returns too low. But a buyer did come forward: the Yunnan Metropolitan Construction Investment Group, a state-owned firm.</p><p class="css-crkmw2 efr6q1o0">This article appeared in the Essay section of the print edition under the headline "The global centre"</p><div class="mdui-container"><img alt="Can pandas fly?
