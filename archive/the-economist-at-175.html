The globalisation of world trade; historically high levels of migration; and a liberal world order premised on America’s willingness to project hard power: they are all things that the elite has sought to bring about and sustain. They are things the elite has done well out of, congratulating itself all the while on its adaptability and openness to change. Sometimes it has merely benefited more visibly than a broad swathe of lesser souls; sometimes it has done so at their expense.</p><p class="article__body-text">The specific liberal philosophy Wilson sought to promulgate was born amid the tumult of industrialisation and in the wake of the French and American revolutions. It drew from the intellectual inheritance of Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke and Adam Smith. That tradition was further shaped by a series of Victorian intellectuals, most notable among them John Stuart Mill, which included this newspaper’s second editor, Walter Bagehot.</p><p class="article__body-text">That liberalism was not today’s. Take foreign affairs. Victorian liberals were often pacifists who welcomed the ties of trade but eschewed military alliances. Later, a tradition of “liberal imperialism” justified colonialism on the basis that it brought progress—in the form of laws, property rights and so forth—to peoples that lacked them. Few make either argument today. <em>The Economist</em> was sceptical of imperialism, arguing in 1862 that colonies “would be just as valuable to us...if they were independent”. But “uncivilised races” were owed “guidance, guardianship and teaching”.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/608/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD002.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text"><em>The Economist</em> has, at times, embraced elements of both, driven by pragmatism and a sense of the present’s shortcomings as much or more than by ideology. When we supported graduated income taxes in the early 20th century, a position Wilson would have scorned, it was in part because those taxes, a Liberal policy, were more to our liking than the protectionist tariffs the Conservatives were touting. After the Depression and the second world war we hewed to Keynesian views that both allowed for significant state involvement in the economy and saw value in liberal nations working together to create a world in which their values could thrive. When we rebelled against the subsequent state overreach to champion the deregulation and privatisation that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan would later bring in, we were moved as much by the failures of the status quo as by libertarian zeal.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Many liberals have become conservative</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">These failures mean that liberalism needs another reinvention. Those in favour of open markets and societies need to see off the threat posed by those who value neither. They also need to do a lot more to honour their promise of progress for all. That means being willing to apply their principles afresh to the existing and emerging problems of the ever-changing, ever-conflicted world.</p><p class="article__body-text">When liberals set up the Anti-Corn Law League to organise protests, petitions and public lectures they did so in the spirit of the Anti-Slavery League, and in the same noble name: freedom. The barriers the league sought to remove did not merely keep people from their cake—bad though such barriers were, and strongly though they were resented. They were barriers that held them back, and which set people against each other. Tearing them down would not just increase the wealth of all. It would bring to an end, James Wilson believed, the “jealousies, animosities and heartburnings between individuals and classes...and...between this country and all others.”</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1597/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/250/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/374/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/499/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/749/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/799/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/998/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1248/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1597/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC303.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">The modern era of multilateral trade negotiation was ushered in by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. It was based on the insight that unilateral tariff reductions, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws, are unstable. The concentrated displeasure of producers exposed to foreign competition is more powerful than the diffuse gratitude of the mass of consumers, and so tariffs get reimposed. If reductions are taken in concert with foreign powers, some producers gain new foreign markets, thus becoming supporters, and the international nature of the obligations makes backsliding harder.</p><p class="article__body-text">Freeing trade in services, such as those of lawyers, architects or airlines, would yield gains six times larger, maybe more. But the WTO, for which nothing is settled until everything is settled, has spent decades failing to reach big deals on services. Nor has it succeeded in stopping China, which joined in 2001, from flouting the spirit, if not always the letter, of its rules by shaking down foreign investors for technologies it fancies and giving under-the-table assistance to its own industries.</p><p class="article__body-text">Defending the existing trade system is thus a paramount goal. And the gains it may yet offer, in services and elsewhere, are substantial. But no one could claim that free trade has the capacity to stir the spirit today in the way that the fight against the Corn Laws did, nor that it offers as much scope for progress in an already globalised world as in the mercantilist 19th century. Modern liberals must look for new reforms where dismantling barriers and increasing freedom will once again produce transformative gains for individuals and society.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/707/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/233/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/349/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/465/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/698/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/744/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/930/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1163/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1488/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD003.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">The best solution to this is not new: it was well known, and pursued by liberals, in the 19th century. Tax landowners according to the underlying market value of the land that they own. Such a tax would capture for society part of the windfall that accrues to a landowner when his local area thrives. Land taxes capable of replacing all existing property taxes (which are raised on the value of what sits on the land, rather than just the land itself) and then some would greatly sharpen the incentive to develop. Because the amount of land is fixed, a land tax, unlike most other taxes, does not distort supply. At the same time, ease planning restrictions. It is no good raising the incentive to develop if regulation then stands in the way. But development rights have been so far collectivised in many cities as to come close to undermining the very notion of property. The curtailment of development rights enriches even owners of vacant plots; if the windfall gains from soaring property values are heavily taxed, NIMBYism will not be such a profitable strategy. The problem is getting those owners to give up the windfall and submit to a land tax in the first place.</p><p class="article__body-text">Part of the answer is a tougher attitude to policing deals and to ensuring that new firms are not unfairly squashed. But when it comes to tech, something fresher and rooted in individual action and competitive markets would be best. One approach is to consider the data that users generate as a good they own or a service they provide for fees.</p><p class="article__body-text">This makes keeping the digital sector open and competitive all the more vital. Barriers to wealth-creation there are bad enough. Dominant companies which might limit, or skew, free expression, open deliberation and self-determination—encouraging “jealousies and animosities” in the realm of ideas—are worse.</p><p class="article__body-text">Third, the modern welfare state complicates the issues around migration in a way that it did not a century ago. Illegal immigrants are not entitled to such benefits. But refugees often qualify, as do the children of people who have arrived illegally. The absolute level of spending may be small; the perception of inequity, though, can be beyond all proportion to the cost. People resent paying taxes to fund benefits that they perceive as going to outsiders.</p><p class="article__body-text">This is not a way to win. Liberals need to temper the most ambitious demands for immigration while finding ways to increase popular support for more moderate flows. They have to recognise that others place greater weight on ethnic and cultural homogeneity than they do, and that this source of conflict cannot be wished away. They must also find ways for the arrival of new migrants to offer tangible benefits to the people worried about their advent.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>IV</strong><br/><span>The new social contract</span></p><p class="article__body-text">The erosive effects of robotisation and artificial intelligence on the world of work are debatable and frequently exaggerated. But though optimists think clever and more dexterous machines will make most of their human colleagues more productive, rather than redundant, they hardly see a return to the 20th-century world of copious lifelong jobs. The coming decades will further strain people’s ability to predict what skills they will need and how their careers will evolve.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/641/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/100/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/150/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/200/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/300/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/321/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/401/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/501/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/641/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESC311.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Many of the idea’s attributes appeal to liberals too. A UBI would reduce the state’s interference in people’s lives. But from the liberal point of view such gains must be set against two big disadvantages, one a matter of principle, one of practicality. The principle is that the 20th-century social contract from which the welfare state was born was that the state would help people help themselves, rather than just give them stuff: it should provide a safety-net, not a platform scattered with silk divans. Liberals tend to believe that people will be happiest if they can achieve self-reliance. And, in practical terms, UBIs would mean either eye-popping increases in tax or cuts in support for the genuinely needy, particularly in countries where welfare spending is already relatively targeted on the poor. In America a UBI of $10,000 a year would require a tax take of at least 33% of GDP—less than the level in many countries, but some $1.5trn more than the current 26%.</p><p class="article__body-text">Liberals have long believed that state control eventually collapses under its inefficiencies and the damage that the abuse of power does to systems that lend themselves to it. But the enthusiasm with which China has embraced digital living has given the Communist Party new tools for political control and responsive tyranny. Cyber-China may not have solved for all time the challenge of identifying and quashing opposition without stirring up more of it. But its efforts in that direction could last longer than hitherto imagined. It would be a foolish mistake to base an international order on the assumption that China will become more liberal any time soon.</p><p class="article__body-text">Faced with this uncomfortable reality, 21st-century liberals must remember two lessons from the 20th. The failure of the League of Nations between the world wars showed that liberal ideals are worthless unless backed by the military power of determined nation states. The defeat of communism showed the strength of committed alliances.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/608/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/articles/body/20180915_ESD005.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Military capabilities are crucial.

The social contract and geopolitical norms that underpin liberal democracies and the world order that sustains them were not built for this century. Geography and technology have produced new concentrations of economic power to tackle. The developed and the developing world alike need fresh ideas for the design of better welfare states and tax systems. The rights of people to move from one country to another need to be redefined. American apathy and China’s rise require a rethinking of the world order—not least because the huge gains that free trade has provided must be preserved.</p><p class="article__body-text">Liberals also need to look at the degree to which self-interest blunts their reforming zeal. The people who produce and promulgate liberal policy are pretty well enmeshed with the increasingly concentrated corporate elite. Its well-heeled baby-boomer bloc is happy to get pensions that economic logic says it should forgo. If there is a greater liberal stronghold than the international institutions which liberals need to reform, it is the universities that they need to reappraise, given the urgent need to support lifetime learning. Liberals have gained the most when they have taken on entrenched power. Now that means attacking both their current allies and their own prerogatives.</p><p class="css-crkmw2 efr6q1o0">This article appeared in the Essay section of the print edition under the headline "The
