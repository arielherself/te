After weeks of harsh heat his land, one and a half hectares (four acres) of peanuts, chillies and mulberry bushes, has turned to dust. At the beginning of June, a dozen families local to Kuppam, a village in the Chittoor district of the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, came together, as they do every year, to sacrifice a goat as a divine downpayment on a good monsoon. By mid-June the monsoon rains should be quenching the parched ground. Yet there is no sign of the livid clouds running up from the south-eastern horizon which serve as its evening harbingers, rising and roiling, filling the sky with their rumbling and the night with veiled lightning. The sky is as blank as the ground is dry. Narayanappa has his sacks of nuts ready to sow. But time is running out.</p><p class="article__body-text">In his office at the India Meteorological Department in New Delhi, Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, the department’s boss, looks at portents which are dry in a different way—figures and lines on paper and screens. Where once the oncoming monsoon was spotted through telescopes on the veranda of the observatory built by the Maharajah of Travancore on a hill above Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala, now the signs of its coming are looked for through tracked radar and satellites. But they are still of intense interest to the country’s rulers, and its people. The monsoon’s arrival in Thiruvananthapuram at the beginning of June marks the official beginning of India’s rainy season. The rains’ subsequent movement is tracked on a daily basis by national television stations, rather like the advance of the spring cherry blossom in Japan but with far greater human consequence.</p><p class="article__body-text">As Guy Fleetwood Wilson, a finance minister, put it in 1909, the “budget of India is a gamble in rain.” Thanks to Mr Rajeevan and his colleagues, the odds of each year’s gamble are now better known. But obvious steps that might lower the stakes being played for are still not taken. Storage systems in cities have fallen into disuse; aquifers under farmland are depleted year by year faster than the monsoons can refill them. In a country where more people will face the risks of climate change in the decades to come than any other, the problems of the current climate are being ducked.</p><p class="article__body-text">The people respond. The rains bring a sense of relief and a new sensuality. In “The Cloud Messenger” by Kalidasa, one of the greatest Sanskrit poets of north India, the meeting of earth and clouds is nothing less than a kind of lovemaking. In the Sangam literature of the deep south, the heroine waits for her lover, who is away seeking war, wealth and adventure, to return with the rains. People still tell stories of inhibitions cast aside and new lovers taken. The heart takes on the driving, unpredictable rhythms of the rain.</p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HE RAINS</small> for which Narayanappa waits are not the whole story. The word “monsoon” blew into English from Portuguese in the late 16th century not because European sailors cared about the rain on alien plains, but because when they followed Vasco da Gama around the tip of Africa they came across a type of wind they had never encountered, and for which they had no name.</p><p class="article__body-text">This is because of the role played in the monsoon by the “intertropical convergence zone” (ITCZ) which encircles the world close to the equator. The ITCZ is a zone of low pressure over the warmest water. In all the oceans, this low pressure draws in steady winds from the south-east known as the southern trade winds.</p><p class="article__body-text">Just as coastal breezes turn around at set of sun, when the land cools fast and the sea stays warm, so monsoons reverse in winter. This is true both for the South Asian monsoon and the East Asian monsoon, which affects Indo-China, the Philippines, southern China, Taiwan, Korea and part of Japan. As the land cools in the autumn, north-easterly winds replace the south-westerlies (see map). Because the winds are mostly dry they are not so important to farmers, though they do bring rain to some parts of southern India. But they matter a great deal to navigation, and thus to human history. The monsoon rains feed what has always been the most populous part of the human world. It is the monsoon winds, though, which brought those people together to form Asia.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/755/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/118/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/177/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/236/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/354/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/378/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/472/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/590/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/755/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esm946.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Winds which reverse with the seasons shaped a maritime world stretching from the Strait of Hormuz in the north-west to the island archipelagoes of South-East Asia, from Madagascar in the south-west to Japan. With patience, this whole world could be traversed in both directions, with vessels set fair for east and north in summer, west and south in the winter—and with layovers enforced by the tropical storms called hurricanes in the Atlantic, typhoons in East Asia and cyclones in the Indian Ocean (the term comes from the Greek kukloma, the coil of a serpent). The winds of the South Asian monsoon suppress the conditions needed for cyclones to form. When the monsoon is over, they come out to play.</p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">J</span><small>UST A FEW</small> hundred kilometres from Narayanappa’s smallholding in Chittoor lie the deltas of the Godavari and the Krishna. India’s second- and fourth-longest rivers, respectively, they rise in the Western Ghats and flow east into the Bay of Bengal. The contrast between straitened Chittoor, at the mercy of its own local rains, and the verdant deltas could not be starker. Water drawn from the rivers and spread across their deltas allows the lowland farmers to raise two crops a year, sometimes three. Satellite pictures show their lush paddy fields of the delta as emerald patches on the brown scrub of the Coromandel coast and the land behind. It is a lesson in the power of water to make or break, and the power of humans to command it.</p><p class="article__body-text">The green of the deltas was not always so reliable. William Roxburgh was a surgeon who left Edinburgh in 1772 to join the East India Company. He settled in Samulcottah (modern-day Samalkota) in the Godavari delta. As Sunil Amrith writes in “Unruly Waters”, a fascinating new history of the monsoon, Roxburgh was one of those who, through measured observation, laid the foundations of modern Indian meteorology. In so doing he came to believe that nature in India was capable of much “improvement”. The Godavari’s cultivators, he pointed out, depended entirely on the rains: “when they fail, a famine is, and must ever be the consequence.” The solution was to harness the water that “passes annually unemployed into the sea”, retaining it for farmers’ year-round use.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp024.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">When famine spread in 1877, the viceroy, Lord Lytton, was determined that such folly should not be repeated. He vehemently opposed district officers’ attempts to stockpile grain, on the basis that it would distort the market. The railways, built with the help of taxes that had impoverished the now starving peasants, ensured that grain could get to where it would fetch the highest price—for example, by being exported to Britain—rather than stay in place, unprofitably saving lives. The administration cut both relief rations and the wage for a punishing day’s work in the relief camps, limiting the victims’ access to markets yet further.</p><p class="article__body-text">One of these features was the “Southern oscillation”. The usual pattern of air pressure over the Pacific features high pressure over Tahiti and low pressure over Darwin, in northern Australia. This dispensation helps drive the trade winds westward the better to feed the monsoon as the intertropical convergence zone sweeps north over India. But a few times a decade a reversal takes place; the pressure that was up goes down, and that which was down goes up. Low pressure over Tahiti and high pressure over Darwin disrupts the trade winds. The South Asian monsoon weakens.</p><p class="article__body-text">The advent of computerised global-climate models capable of capturing the effects of far-flung changes in sea-surface temperature at a reasonable level of detail has in the past decade given Walker’s heirs more confidence in predicting the South Asian monsoon’s relative strength. It has also underscored the complexity of the climate system and its interactions with human history. It is now clear that the failures of the monsoon which the British exacerbated in the late 19th century were due to very powerful “super El Niños”. Some climate models suggest that these will occur more often in a warming world. Others, though, disagree. Climate modelling has improved understanding of the monsoon from year to year. But if you take the models which best capture the effects of ENSO in the 20th century and ask what they have to say about how it will work in the hotter 21st century, you find no consensus.</p><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">T</span><small>HERE IS ONE</small> thing the locals do not talk about in the wettest place on Earth: the rain.

Just one instance: in late June, Chennai, India’s sixth-biggest city, was officially declared to have run out of water. Its municipal authorities blamed the drought. Yet years ago they abandoned any coherent policy of water supply. Not only did they not factor in new water capacity or conservation measures. They allowed developers to fill in the water tanks and seasonal lakes for which the city was once famous. The towers of gated communities now rise on these lake beds. A giant billboard outside one such development, Golden Opulence, in Chennai’s western exurbs, promises well-heeled buyers limitless water as a chief sales pitch. The supply is guaranteed by the tankers of a well-established “water mafia” whose thousands of soot-belching lorries are a continuous threat to the city’s air, pedestrians and cyclists. Their cargo disgorged, they return to the countryside—specifically, to places where farmers lucky enough to sit atop an aquifer replenish them for city cash. For farmers wealthy enough to drill a bore hole and install an electric pump this is a doddle, not least because electricity for farmers is essentially free. Mining water beats farming crops.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/articles/body/20190629_esp026.jpg 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Narayanappa, in Chittoor district, has no such scam to support him.

And even in better years than this one, bore-well water is not always sweet or safe to drink, given naturally occurring levels of arsenic.
