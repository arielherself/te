His carp are dead: the Russian soldiers who occupied his farm in March and April fished for them by tossing grenades into the water. Russian shells blew holes in the farm’s new office and its automated milking stall. Mr Tkachenko reckons his losses at roughly $1m, including 158 cows, about half his herd. “The Russians killed them and ate the parts that were easy to butcher,” he says. “They left the rest to rot.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet by mid-October the farm, in Lukashivka, 120km north of Kyiv, was bustling again. In a vast concrete storage shed, forklifts stacked crates of potatoes while workers supervised machines that use lasers to sort the spuds by size. Most of Mr Tkachenko’s fields were free of mines, his wheat, corn and sunflower crops had been harvested, his grain elevator had been fixed and his remaining cows were chomping away in their pens. </p><p class="article__body-text">Recovering from all this, Ukraine’s allies think, will require aid comparable to the Marshall Plan, the huge American programme that kickstarted Europe’s economic recovery from the second world war. Indeed, in some ways rebuilding Ukraine seems harder. Unlike the Marshall Plan, which started years after the war ended, aid to Ukraine is flowing while the shells are still flying. That makes attracting private money almost impossible, for now: foreign investment into Ukraine is barely 1% of its level in 2021. With the war slashing tax revenues and half of the government’s budget devoted to the army, Ukraine needs $3.5-5bn in aid every month just to cover its budget deficit.</p><p class="article__body-text">History offers useful lessons. Although the Marshall Plan is now remembered as a success, things were complicated at the time, says Margaret MacMillan, a historian at Oxford. “There were real strains within [the Marshall Plan], real difficulties, moments when it might have collapsed,” she says. There was bitter disagreement within America’s government over how to structure the programme, and within Congress over whether to fund it at all. European governments and voters were suspicious of the conditions attached to the aid. Only the threat of communism persuaded all sides to overcome their qualms. And though the plan was a success in West Germany, its results in some other countries were mediocre. To understand why it is worth trying to help Ukrainians rebuild, it helps to consider how difficult the Marshall Plan actually was.</p><p class="article__body-text">In mid-1947, two years after the Nazi surrender, Europe’s economies were still in ruins. Germany, divided into American, British, French and Soviet zones, subsisted on American humanitarian aid. In the British zone rations had fallen to 1,050 calories per day. In the Soviet zone factories were being dismantled, or their products shipped east, as war reparations, while in the French one quotas of German goods were sent to France at cut-rate prices. Industrial production was capped for fear of reviving Germany’s military might, and commerce between the zones was restricted. Josef Stalin, the Soviet leader, blocked all attempts by America and Britain to liberalise trade unless they would agree to create a unified German government—which he planned to subvert and control, as he had throughout eastern Europe.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy"   src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/830/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/273/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/410/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/546/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/819/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/874/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1092/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1365/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1747/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP003.jpg 1280w"  alt="People look at the unloading of a shipment of American tractors from the United States, destined for French agriculture, on January 7, 1949 at the port of Le Havre, in presence of Pierre Pfimlin, French Minister of Agriculture, and David K.

(The final sum would be equivalent to 5% of America’s <small>GDP</small> in 1948.) American dollars would solve Europe’s shortage of foreign exchange, allowing its industries to trade their way to prosperity. They would also be a prize to induce European governments to relax the restrictions paralysing their economies—a way for America to “knock heads together and impose an agreement,” as this newspaper advocated at the time.</p><p class="article__body-text">Instead, Marshall invited the Soviets to join. They would no doubt have tried to sabotage the programme, but the hope was that the conditions placed on the grants (open trade integrating all of Europe, rather than quota-based trade oriented towards Moscow) would make them reject the plan. The gamble paid off: Stalin did just that, and told his new satellites in eastern Europe to stay out, too. Communist parties in western Europe were ordered to denounce the aid offer as capitalist imperialism in disguise—and were sidelined by governments eager for American money.</p><p class="article__body-text">So long as the war continues, graft is not the chief concern. Much of the money flowing into Ukraine now goes on immediate priorities such as paying salaries and social benefits. Those are easy to verify because they can be traced to individuals, says Mr Banerji. Other aid is spent repairing the power grid and other infrastructure. Demand is so intense that few people think there is much skimming going on. </p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/255/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/383/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/511/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/766/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/817/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1021/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1276/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1634/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRC668.png 1280w"  alt=""/></div><p class="article__body-text">Ukraine’s government expects this phase of foreign aid to last as long as the war does. Even here, the sums involved are considerable (see chart). In the first international donors’ conference, in Lugano in July, Ukraine presented an enormous national recovery plan, with hundreds of projects that had been suggested in a month-long consultation between the government, business and civil-society groups. At a second meeting in Berlin on October 25th, the ambitions were more sober. Oleksiy Chernyshov, then minister of development (he has since been appointed head of Naftogaz, the state gas company), outlined three stages of aid. The initial wartime phase might last from 18-36 months. About $38bn is needed to cover the budget deficit in 2023, says Oleksandr Hryban, deputy economy minister. </p><p class="article__body-text">There are other ways to keep tabs on where the cash ends up. After the revolution in 2014 civil-society groups, programmers and government reformers developed Prozorro, a digital system for monitoring state procurement. It is now considered among the best open procurement systems in the world. Since 2016, all of the paperwork associated with every Ukrainian government contract has been available online. Thousands of investigative reporters and volunteer busybodies, known as Dozorro, comb through the database looking for anomalies that could lead to lawsuits or juicy articles.</p><div class="mdui-container"><img loading="lazy"   src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/113/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/169/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/225/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/338/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/360/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/450/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20221112_IRP002.jpg 1280w"  alt="Volunteers clear rubble on the ground floor of Zhanna and Serhiy Dynaeva&amp;#39;s house which was destroyed by Russian bombardment, in the village of Novoselivka, near Chernihiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022.

That degraded the system a bit, says Mr Lakhtionov: the algorithms it uses to search for tenders that look suspicious do not work as well when there are fewer to compare. But most contracting is gradually being put back online, says Nadiya Bigun, deputy minister of economics responsible for procurement. </p><script src="https://arielherself.github.io/espresso-native/mdui-v1.0.2/js/mdui.min.js"></script>
